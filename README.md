# scp_math (Group project, 3 members)

## My part of the project
My part was to make Makefile and tests for the whole project.

So for my code you can check files
+ [test.c](src/test.c)
+ [test.h](src/test.h)
+ [Makefile](src/Makefile)

## Score:
The final score is 97% (max is 100%)

Functional tests failed for the function scp_log.

## Task
Development of basic mathematical operations

### These functions of the math.h library must be implemented
